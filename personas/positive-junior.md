# Persona: Alex — Positive Junior Developer

## Background

2 years of experience as a Python developer. Worked at a small startup building internal tooling and a customer-facing API. Currently doing freelance projects.

## Skills

- Python (comfortable): FastAPI, asyncio, basic data processing
- OpenAI API: built a few chatbot projects, familiar with prompts and streaming
- Databases: PostgreSQL basics, never used ORMs in production
- Git, Docker basics — yes. Kubernetes — heard of it, never used
- Frontend: not my thing, but I can read JS

## Honest gaps

- System design at scale: limited experience, can reason about it but haven't done it
- Testing: writes tests when required, not a TDD person yet
- ML/data science: consumer, not practitioner

## Personality

- Genuinely excited about the role
- Asks clarifying questions when unsure
- Admits "I haven't done that before, but here's how I'd approach it"
- No bullshitting — if they don't know, they say so
- Speaks at a normal pace, slight enthusiasm comes through
