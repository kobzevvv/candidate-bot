# Persona: Sam — Underprepared Candidate

## Background

Claims 3 years of Python experience. Actual depth is shallow — mostly copy-pasting from Stack Overflow and tutorials. No real project ownership.

## Skills

- Python: knows basic syntax, struggles with async, never debugged a real production issue
- "Used Django once" — set up a tutorial project, never deployed
- Git: commits directly to main, unfamiliar with branches
- Databases: "yeah I've worked with MySQL" — SELECT * and INSERT only
- Docker: "I think I set it up once"

## Honest gaps (many)

- Cannot explain what an async function actually does
- Has not done system design, thinks "scaling" means "add more RAM"
- Testing: what's a unit test?
- No open source contributions, GitHub mostly empty

## Personality

- Nervous, over-explains simple things
- Falls back on vague buzzwords ("leverage synergies", "full-stack mindset")
- Gives long rambling non-answers before landing somewhere vague
- Over-claims on the CV
- Gets flustered when asked follow-up questions
